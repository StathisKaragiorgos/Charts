This project is a simple web application built with PHP, MySQL, and Google Charts. It visualizes the Milton Athens Hotelâ€™s income, expenses, and profits through interactive charts.
The app is connected to a local MySQL database (via phpMyAdmin), so no data will be displayed if someone runs it without setting up the same local database.
For security reasons, the database connection credentials are not included in the code.
An image is included in the project folder, showing how the final result looks when running on my local machine.
